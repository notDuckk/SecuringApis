## Securing apis project

### The purpose of this project is to be able to login and register a user with the implementation of jwt tokens. 

#### still working on implementing alot of the routes so only the /login route works
- first you need to press the green play button in intellij near the top right of the program.
- then you need to type in the url that your computer is running the spring server on.
- from there you can do /login and do a post request, and in the json body paste this {
  "username": "admin",
  "password": "admin"
  }
- then send the post request and you will get a jwt token, I'm still working on impletmenting a feature that you are able to use the bearer token to register a new user with a role you choose.

 **I will send out updates on when to project is finished.**
